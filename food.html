        <h2>What is junk food?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Junk foods are termed as “junk” because they don't contain any beneficial nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fibre. People often eat them to fulfill their food cravings and in return, they get only health problems and nothing else.
            Junk foods like burgers, pizza, French fries, cakes, chocolates, soft drinks, etc. have become so popular these days that people are very much obsessed with these types of foods irrespective of their age. They are reluctant to change the diet even after knowing the health hazards of having junk foods.

                Repercussions of junk foods:
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    • Since junk foods are highly processed foods, excess consumption of these foods leads to overweight/obesity. <br>
                    • Simultaneously, this overweight contributes to type 2 diabetes. <br>
                    • Junk foods contain high amounts of salt, which contributes to High Blood Pressure. <br>
                    • The high levels of fat in junk foods leads to cholesterol and this could be a risk factor for heart attacks. <br>
                    • According to researchers, imbibing junk foods will leave a bad effect on the adolescent brain. <br>

                    <h2>Substitutes for junk foods:</h2> 
                    <br>
                    <p>Many people think that they can't find better alternative foods when compared to junk foods, but it's not true. By changing the ingredients, we can try to make these foods even tastier and in a healthy way by varying the ingredients.  Nowadays, most restaurants are serving vegan cuisine. These restaurants should be encouraged as they are introducing lip-smacking recipes with healthy ingredients.</p>
